            <h2>What is MERN?</h2>

            <p> <b>MERN:</b> The MERN stack is a JavaScript stack 
                that’s designed to make the development process smoother. 
                MERN includes four open-source components: MongoDB, Express, 
                React, and Node.js. These components provide an end-to-end 
                framework for developers to work in.
            </p>
            
            <br>

            <h2>The Benefits of the MERN Stack...</h2>
            <br>
            
            <div class="fakeimg">Last Updated: 1 May, 2021</div>
            <br>

            <p><b>Good use:</b> The main advantage for developers using 
                the MERN stack is that every line of code is written in 
                JavaScript. This is a programming language that’s used 
                everywhere, both for client-side code and server-side code. 
                With one language across tiers, there’s no need for context 
                switching.<br>
                <br>

                For tech stack with multiple programming languages, developers 
                have to figure out how to interface them together. With the JavaScript 
                stack, developers only need to be proficient in JavaScript and JSON.<br>
                <br>

                Overall, using the MERN stack enables developers to build highly efficient 
                web applications.

            </p>

            <h2>How does the MERN stack work?</h2>

            <div class="fakeimg">Last Updated: 30 Apr, 2021</div>
            <br>

            <p><b>Process:</b> The MERN architecture allows you to 
                easily construct a 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, 
                database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.
                <br>
                
                <h4>React.js Front End</h4>
                
                <br>
                The top tier of the MERN stack is 
                React.js, the declarative JavaScript 
                framework for creating dynamic client-side 
                applications in HTML. React lets you build up 
                complex interfaces through simple Components, 
                connect them to data on your backend server, 
                and render them as HTML.<br>

                <br>

                React’s strong suit is handling stateful, data-driven 
                interfaces with minimal code and minimal pain, and it 
                has all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern 
                web framework: great support for forms, error handling, 
                events, lists, and more.<br>

                <br>

                <h4>Express.js and Node.js Server Tier</h4>
                
                <br>
                The next level down is the Express.js server-side 
                framework, running inside a Node.js server. Express.js 
                bills itself as a “fast, unopinionated, minimalist web 
                framework for Node.js,” and that is indeed exactly what it is. 
                Express.js has powerful models for URL routing (matching an incoming 
                URL with a server function), and handling HTTP requests and responses.<br>

                <br>

                React’s strong suit is handling stateful, data-driven 
                interfaces with minimal code and minimal pain, and it

                web framework: great support for forms, error handling, 
                events, lists, and more.

            <h2>Why choose the MERN stack?</h2>
            <br>
            
            <div class="fakeimg">Last Updated: 1 May, 2021</div>
            <br>

            <p><b>Good use:</b> MongoDB was designed to store JSON data natively 
                (it technically uses a binary version of JSON called BSON), and 
                everything from its command line interface to its query language 
                (MQL, or MongoDB Query Language) is built on JSON and JavaScript.<br>
                <br>

                MongoDB works extremely well with Node.js, and makes storing, 
                manipulating, and representing JSON data at every tier of your 
                application incredibly easy. For cloud-native applications, MongoDB 
                Atlas makes it even easier, by giving you an auto-scaling MongoDB cluster 
                on the cloud provider of your choice, as easy as a few button clicks.<br>
                <br>

                Express.js (running on Node.js) and React.js make the JavaScript/JSON 
                application MERN full stack, well, full. Express.js is a server-side 
                application framework that wraps HTTP requests and responses, and makes 
                it easy to map URLs to server-side functions. React.js is a frontend JavaScript 
                framework for building interactive user interfaces in HTML, and communicating with 
                a remote server.<br>
                <br>

                The combination means that JSON data flows naturally from front to back, making it 
                fast to build on and reasonably simple to debug. Plus, you only have to know one programming 
                language, and the JSON document structure, to understand the whole system!<br>
                <br>

                MERN is the stack of choice for today’s web developers looking to move quickly, particularly 
                for those with React.js experience.
