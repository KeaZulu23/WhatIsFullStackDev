            <h2>What are Servers?</h2>
            <br>

            <p> <b>Servers:</b> A web server is a computer that runs websites. 
                It's a computer program that distributes web pages as they are 
                requisitioned. The basic objective of the web server is to store, process and 
                deliver web pages to the users. This intercommunication is done using Hypertext 
                Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br>

                <br>

                The main job of a web server is to display the website content. If a web server 
                is not exposed to the public and is used internally, then it is called Intranet 
                Server. When anyone requests for a website by adding the URL or web address on a 
                web browser’s (like Chrome or Firefox) address bar (like www.economictimes.com), 
                the browser sends a request to the Internet for viewing the corresponding web page 
                for that address.<br>

                <br>

                The Web Server is requested to present the content website to the user’s browser. 
                All websites on the Internet have a unique identifier in terms of an IP address.<br>

            </p>
            
            <br>

            <h2>Types of Servers?</h2>
            <br>
            
            <div class="fakeimg">Last Updated: 30 Apr, 2021</div>
            <br>

            <p><b>Types:</b> There are many types of servers that all 
                perform different functions. Many networks contain one 
                or more of the common server types:<br>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>File servers.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Application servers.</b></li>
                    <li><b>DNS servers.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Web servers.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Database servers.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Monitoring and management servers.</b></li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <br>

            <h5>What types of server functions are typically implemented for the
                back-end of a web application?</h5>
            <br>
            
            <div class="fakeimg">Last Updated: 1 May, 2021</div>
            <br>

            <p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Application servers.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Proxy servers.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Web servers.</b></li>
                </ul>

                <b>Role of Each:</b> These functions are of many types of servers that all 
                perform differently.<br>

                <br>
                <b>Application Servers:</b> An application server is a server that hosts 
                applications. Application server frameworks are software frameworks for 
                building application servers. An application server framework provides 
                both facilities to create web applications and a server environment to 
                run them. <br>

                <br>
                <b>Proxy Servers:</b> A proxy server is a computer system or router 
                that functions as a relay between client and server. It helps prevent an 
                attacker from invading a private network and is one of several tools used 
                to build a firewall. <br>

                <br>
                <b>Web Servers:</b> A web server is computer software and underlying hardware 
                that accepts requests via HTTP, the network protocol created to distribute web 
                pages, or its secure variant HTTPS. The basic objective of the web server is to 
                store, process and deliver web pages to the users. <br>

            </p>

            <h2>What happens when a browser is used to send a request to a server?</h2>
            <br>

            <p> <b>Process:</b> Let's dive into how the web works provides a simplified view 
                of what happens when you view a webpage in a web browser on your computer or 
                phone.<br> Our analogy that is like walking into a shop.

                <br>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of 
                        the server that the website lives on (you find the address of the shop).</b></li><br>
                    
                    <li><b>The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it 
                        to send a copy of the website to the client (you go to the shop and 
                        order your goods). This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.</b></li><br>
                    
                    <li><b>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here 
                        it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets (the shop gives you your goods, and you 
                        bring them back to your house).</b></li><br>
                    
                    <li><b>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you (the goods arrive at your door — new shiny stuff, awesome!).</b></li><br>
                </ol>

            <h2>SSR vs CSR?</h2>
            <br>
            
            <div class="fakeimg">Last Updated: 1 May, 2021</div>
            <br>

            <p><b>What is SSR:</b> SSR stands for server-side rendering. 
                It is the ability of a web application to render the web 
                page on the server instead of rendering it in the browser. 
                When the page arrived on the client-side, it is fully rendered. 
                It is because the server-side has fully rendered the page before 
                it was sent by the server to the client. When the request is received 
                on the server-side, it will compile everything, if the content of the 
                page needed data from the database, the server will do that, then render 
                the data into the fully rendered page and then send it to the client as the 
                response.<br>

                <br>

                <b>What is CSR:</b> CSR stands for client-side rendering. 
                Overall, CSR is the opposite of SSR. If the SSR renders the page on the server-side, 
                CSR renders the page on the client-side. When the request is received on the server, 
                it will not render the page, instead, the server will send a single page that will be 
                the skeleton of the page to the client. The server sends the page along with the javascript file. 
                Later, the JS will turn the page into a fully rendered page.<br>

            </p>

            <br>

            <h5>What is the difference?</h5>
            <br>
            
            <div class="fakeimg">Last Updated: 1 May, 2021</div>
            <br>

            <p> The main difference between CSR and SSR is where the 
                page is rendered. SSR renders the page on the server-side 
                and CSR renders the page on the client-side. Client-side manages 
                the routing dynamically without refreshing the page every time the 
                client requests a different route.

                <b>You may use SSR:</b> If SEO is your priority, typically when you are building 
                a blog site and you want everyone who searching on google go to your website, if 
                your website needs a faster initial loading, if the content of your website doesn't 
                need much user interaction, then SSR is your choice.<br>

                <br>
                <b>You may use CSR:</b> When SEO is not your priority, if your site has rich 
                interactions, if you are building a web application, then CSR is your choice. <br>
